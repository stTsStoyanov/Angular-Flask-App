Angular/TypeScript app with Python/Flask backend


The final version is located in branch "swagger" it is not merged to "main".

When you pull do next:

1) In folder my-angular-app:
-> run: npm install

2) in folder API:
-> run: pip install flask
-> run: pip install flask-cors
-> run: pip install flask-swagger-ui
-> run: pip install flask-restful-swagger
-> run: pip install --upgrade flask           ----- in my case i needed to update it
-> run: pip install --upgrade flask flask-cors flask-swagger-ui                ----- in my case i needed to update it
-> run:pip install flask-swagger-ui

3) In two terminals / git_bash run:
-> 1-st terminal:      in folder my-angular-app: ng serve
-> 2-nd terminal:    in folder API: python app.py

Once these steps are done the project is ready.
